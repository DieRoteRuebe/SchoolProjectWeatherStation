Notes

* All libraries are open source and compatible with the Arduino IDE.
* Some libraries (like Adafruit's) require installing dependencies via the Arduino Library Manager.
* Ensure you have the latest versions installed for best compatibility.

Let me know if you'd like a German version or to include this in a combined document (like a report or full documentation bundle).
